                                <p>
                                    Dear Delegates,
                                </p>
                                <p>In my capacity as the President for the European Council (EC), it is an honour to welcome you to DSMUN 2016. I am currently in my final school year as a student in the ISC Humanities stream. My range of interests encompasses debating, MUN-ing, dramatics and squash. I have been an avid MUN-ner since the 9th grade and have attended 7 MUN conferences over the past few years, including the prestigious Harvard MUN in India. Diplomacy and foreign relations are areas of study that immensely interest me, making MUN-ing natural extension of my interests.</p>
                                <p>The first agenda is a seemingly more pertinent issue that deals with the current refugee influx into the European Union. This debate will be different from the ones in other similar committees you might have visited earlier because the mandate of the European Council on this issue is much broader than any other committee’s The second Agenda will require immense reading and understanding of the structural set up of the EU, as it deals with an area of EU policy that needs to be discussed taking into account the recent issue of ‘Brexit’ as an epitomic example of the agenda’s implications.</p>
                                <p>I would like to hand you a few basic tips to make sure our discussion takes place in a structured and coherent fashion and that we arrive at the best possible outcome.  First off, do try and structure the debate in an orderly manner; this applies to the entire cabinet as well as individual speeches. Always remember that good in-depth research will be your best and only friend in this committee, when backed with substantivizes and practicality in your points. Thirdly, never shy away from critically analyzing the material that you gather. Lastly, do read about the mandate of this committee so you understand the powers that you, as delegates of your country, hold.</p>

                                <p>To conclude, I would like you to know that you are always welcome to address any doubts, clarifications or queries you may require to be answered through the course of your preparation to us, and expect prompt answers.</p>
                                <p>Embrace yourselves for three days of enriching debate, diplomacy and forging relationships that shall last with you forever. I look forward to seeing you here at Chandbagh,</p>

                          <h3>Agenda 1: European Migration Crisis</h3>
                          <p><b>"Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution."  - Article 14, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights</b></p>
                          <p>War-torn areas in neighboring Africa and the Middle- Eastern regions have in the last 5 years prompted thousand and thousands to leave their native countries and seek asylum in Europe, the nearest and best option for all of the people displaced owing to civil war, poverty and social distress in their own countries. The Schengen Free Movement agreement coupled with different methods of different countries for dealing with refugees has made migration in Europe an increasingly difficult and intricate problem to deal with.</p>
                          <p>The EU-Turkey deal though provides short term remedies, fails to address the long-term issues of migration that pose a massive threat to the security and stability of the EU. A UNHCR report published in February 2016 predicts that up to 1 million refugees and migrants could attempt to use the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkan route to Europe in 2016. Time is constrained and the need of crucial changes in the asylum policy of the EU and member nations’ border security laws will determine the future of the EU.</p>
                          <h3>Sovereignty of Member States in the EU</h3>
                          <p>In a federal structure like the EU, it is completely necessary that there are no conflicts of interest between the center and the member nations of the EU.  ‘Brexit’, the portmanteau for the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU was an ideal example where there was a conflict of interest between the center union and a member nation. Though various compromises were made from the side of the EU, a uniform law for all member nations in relation to the EU fails to exist. The existing legislation of the EU which complies to the principle of subsidiarity and proportionality proves to interfere with the sovereign interests of the member nations and increase regulatory burden for EU business operators. The need for the subsidiarity control mechanism in the EU to be altered according to greater jurisdiction and participation of national parliaments is hence the vital step in ensuring greater sovereignty of member states. The need for having specific criteria in determining the admissibility and compliance of the subsidiarity control mechanism at the EU level will be another crucial move in the direction of eliminating the breach of sovereignty of member nations.</p>
