                                    Dear delegates,
                                </p>
                                <p>As the chairperson of the Human Rights Council, it gives me immense pleasure to welcome you to the 10th Doon School Model United Nations Conference 2016. My name is Kanav Agarwal and I am currently studying in The Doon School, pursuing the ISC curriculum in Grade 12.</p>
                                <p>I am passionate about playing Basketball and Table Tennis, and my love for these sports has only grown over time. The first MUN I attended was DSMUN 2013 as a ‘chit boy’ and since then I have attended several MUNs including Harvard MUN China and Harvard MUN India.</p>
                                <p>The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) is a United Nations System inter-governmental body which is responsible for promoting and protecting human rights around the world. Throughout history, women and children have been involved in and affected by war, conflict and social unrest. In recent years there has been a prevalence of such incidents around the globe. Also the disabled are neglected in the society and are looked down upon. The agendas this year relate to these issues and it is our duty as a committee to protect the rights of these people and help them live a peaceful and comfortable life.</p>
                                <p>I expect several things from my delegates over the course of the conference. Most importantly, I want a high quality of debate, with the committee taking a holistic approach to the agendas. Delegates must keep in mind the policies and relations of nation they are representing at the time of discussion of the agenda. Furthermore, I will be enforcing a strict policy regarding the following of procedure in committee, including the punctual submission of policy statements before the start of the conference.</p>
                                <p>I hope the committee will be an opportunity for you to gain an insight in the art of diplomacy, understand the value of collaboration and compromise, and build skills in public speaking and debating. I look forward to meeting all of you at the conference! Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions you may have.</p>
                                <p>The agendas that will be discussed this year are:</p>
                                <p><ul><li><b>The impact of terrorism on women and children rights in the Middle East and the Arabic world</b></li>
                                <li><b>The Realisation of Rights of Persons with Disabilities</b></li></ul></p>
                                <p>Hope to see you all this fall!</p>

                          <h3>Agenda 1: The humanitarian impact of terrorism on women and children rights in the middle east and the arabic world.</h3>
                          <h3>Agenda 2: Military Use of Children</h3>
                          <p>
                            Tens of thousands of children are recruited to serve as soldiers or otherwise in armed conflict. A
                            child soldier is one who is below 18 years of age and can be used as fighters to take part in
                            hostilities, to provide assistance in the form of spies, cooks, servants, messengers etc. and are
                            also used as human shields to gain leverage over others. Girl children are also used by various
                            non-state actors and are exploited and raped. Hence it does not pertain to only those children who
                            take a direct part in hostilities. Children are abducted, coerced, pressurised or voluntarily decide to
                            enroll either to get revenge for violence committed against their loved ones or as they feel that it is
                            the only way to remain safe. An environment of neediness and displacement make kids even more
                            vulnerable to join these armed forces. Despite the fact that infringement of children’s rights is
                            strongly denounced by all we still have to battle with this issue in the twenty first century. This is
                            one of the gravest ILO violations and a serious war crime. It has a great physical and psychological
                            impact on children as they grow up without knowing anything but war, fear and hate. It is our
                            prerogatives a committee to propose solutions to protect the rights of these children and hold any
                            such inhuman people recruiting children accountable.
