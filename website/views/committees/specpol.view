                                    Dear Delegates,
                                </p>
                                <p>As the chairperson of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, it is my distinct pleasure to welcome you to the 10th stimulation of Doon School Model United Nations. My name is Saksham Goel and I am in the final year of my school life at Doon and am pursuing the ISC curriculum. I have been involved in MUNs for the past three years and have attended several national and international conferences. Aside from MUN, I have keen interests in politics, football and economics.</p>
                                <p>As far as the committee is concerned, SPECPOL is the Fourth Committee of the UN General Assembly. While SPECPOL was derived from the Disarmament and International Security Committee, it takes on issues that the First Committee does not address, as well as looking at topics with a wider scope. Unlike other UN committees, SPECPOL shines a spotlight on issues pertaining to occupation, colonization, and subjugation, with the primary goal of making all countries independent and self-sufficient from outside powers and it also discusses the matters of self-determination, decolonization, and peacekeeping.</p>
                                <p>Being the chairperson of such a highly consequential committee, I hope to effectively create an ethos of conflict, debate and high diplomatic rigour. The decisions you make as a committee could determine the future trajectory of the world map, therefore the participation of all countries is required and it is a must for all the delegates to stick to their foreign and domestic policies.</p>
                                <p>This year, the agendas that will be adressed in SPECPOL are:</p>
                                <p><ul><li><b>The Kurdistan Question</b></li><li><b>Establihment of a Permanent Government in Tibet</b></li></ul></p>
                                <p>With that I bid you good luck and hope to see you at Chandbagh this fall.</p>

                          <h3>Agenda 1: Establishing a Permanent Government in Tibet</h3>
                          <p>Tibet is under the clout of two sets of authorities – Tibetan Autonomous region under the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the government in exile (Central Tibetan Administration) whose nerve centre lies in Dharamsala in India. The Central Tibetan Administration views PRC’s rule with condemnation and calls it colonial and illegitimate and states that PRC is led solely by motive to bolster its own strategic position and obtain natural resources available with Tibet. The PRC argues that historically Tibet was under the territory of China. Hostilities between these two blocks are on the rise, people seem to be unresponsive and there seems to be no clear indication in favour of these two governments. Upholding peace and sovereignty of nations and protecting the interests and rights of the people, this is where the United Nations has to intervene. It lies with the SPECPOL to formulate policies and plans to establish a permanent government in Tibet and effectively mitigating hostilities between the authorities.</p>
                          <h3>Agenda 2: The Question of Kurdistan</h3>
                          <p>Kurdistan essentially comprises south-eastern Turkey, northern Syria, northern Iraq and north-western Iran. The Kurds represent one of the largest Middle Eastern ethnicities and are demanding an independent nation. After the first Iraqi war, the United Nations established a safe-zone in northern Iraq, which became an autonomous Kurdish region. The middle-eastern countries look at an independent Kurdistan as a deplorable threat to their territorial integrity. There is deep-seated hostility between the Middle-eastern states and the countries’ Kurds and the question of granting independence to Kurdistan cannot be left unheeded for long. With United States and the West trying to help the Kurds, there is a risk for an all-out war in the Middle-east. Will the Middle-eastern countries willingly give up their territories? Do the Kurds deserve to get a separate nation? How will the principles of self-determination and statehood play out? It remains with SPECPOL to decide the fate of Kurdistan. </p>
