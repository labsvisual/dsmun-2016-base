                                    Dear delegates,
                                </p>
                                <p>My name is Rishi Raj Deva, and I am pleased to welcome you the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). For this year’s committee, I’d strongly advise delegates to familiarise themselves with nature and scope of this committee, and what it entails. I expect arguments and speeches to be logical and nuanced. Don’t bring a big stack of research material and gun me with facts which ultimately lead to nothing, the purpose is to test your diplomacy skills, not your research skills, even though they do still count, obviously.</p>
                                <p>Both the agendas I have chosen encompass a wide range of issues pertaining to illicit drug use and the perpetuation of terrorism and organised crime. Narco-terrorism has long since served as a means of funding for terrorist organisations and the intimidation and control of governments, the most famous example being Pablo Escobar who led the Medellin drug cartel and terrorised the Colombian government during his time as a drug lord, thus forcing them to re-evaluate its extradition treaty. Similarly Cyber Espionage is one of the most recent yet most prominent issues in the modern world of cyberspace and has only been facilitated due to increased cyber dependency. In 2009, a cyber-espionage network called ‘Ghost-Net’ accessed confidential information belonging to both governmental and private organisations in over 100 countries around the world. Cyber conflicts can be seen as a mirror of their real-world counterparts, but also increasingly as completely independent disputes, clashes, attacks and perhaps acts of war in an emerging arena.</p>
                                <p>As for myself, I have been in the MUN circuit for about 3 years now. I’ve attended both national and international MUNs., I have taken part in committees ranging from 15 to 350 people and everything in between, including GA’s, SC’s and specialised committees. I am an avid debater, reader and while most of my time is spent in dealing with the relentlessness of the IB, what I can salvage is spent mostly at the gym or at the squash courts.</p>
                                <p>All that remains for me to say is that gear up, prepare and make the best of your time at Chandbagh. For those new to MUN, I’d strongly recommend using this experience as a platform for future MUNs and the rest, fully engage in debate and be an active part of committee. Remember, delegates that while research and eloquence do play an important role, the true test of your skill lies in diplomacy and that is exactly what I hope DSMUN, this year, can bring out of you.</p>

                          <h3>Agenda 1: Narco-Terrorism</h3>
                          <p>Narco-terrorism, according to the US Drug Enforcement Agency, refers to the “participation of groups or associated individuals in taxing, providing security for, otherwise aiding or abetting drug trafficking endeavors in an effort to further, or fund, terrorist activities” (Holmberg, 2009). In this context, a clear line needs to be drawn between the two aspects of the issue: Drugs and Terrorism. Terrorist groups such as the Colombian FARC and the Taliban in Afghanistan, among Others, are considered to use narcotic and illicit drugs trafficking as a way to finance their actions. This kind of narco-terrorism suggests that trafficking enables these groups to have the funds to achieve their separate agendas. In reality, trafficking and armed violence by members of drug cartels and narco-terrorist groups can become a separate activity on its own, to which politics is secondary. The number of drug related deaths today is at an all-time high, taking millions of lives annually. Moreover, these numbers are expected to grow in coming years due to exponential increases in drug addiction, only driven by the influence of narco-terrorism.</p>
                          <h3>Agenda 2: Cyber Espionage amongst Non-State Actors</h3>
                          <p>The creation of Cyberspace also led to the creation of threats to cyber security. The often cited “cyber-attacks” on targets in Estonia in the spring of 2007 is a clear example of where volunteers actively took part in an open cyber conflict, acting as a sort of cyber militia, by rallying to overload various cyberspace resources, such as Estonian government and commercial web services. Another famous and much heard of is example is Anonymous, a collective of so-called “hacktivists”, who have been claiming responsibility for several widely publicised web defacements, information leaks, denial-of-service attacks, and other cyber actions sometimes related to national security or military affaires. All countries may be affected by this. Large countries can be tempted and may get into conflicts because they have the power and ability to conduct cyber espionage on another country. Smaller countries may be affected because they are a much easier target. They can be weaker and tend to be coerced by larger and stronger countries. Also, clear limitations must be set in order to distinguish between which acts can or cannot be considered as cyber-crime. The moral aspect of the issue is also one which needs to be discussed. Keeping this in mind, this issue needs to see a fairly unanimous resolution due to it’s potential to affect several countries worldwide.</p>
