                                Greetings Delegates,
                                </p>
                                <p>Welcome to the 10th Session of the Doon School Model United Nations.</p>
                                <p>My name is Tushaar Sharma and I’m going to be your chairperson of the Security Council, 2016. I felt that at this year’s Security Council we must discuss the most pressing issues that seem to serve as a threat to world peace and security.</p>
                                <p>My MUN’ing career so to speak began in grade 9 where I took part in our very own DSMUN in the capacity of an official at the very same committee I’ll be chairing this year- the Security Council! At my second DSMUN in 2014 I was a delegate in UNSC too! From then I have taken part in various regional and international MUN’s such as HMUN China, MCGSMUN and our very own DSMUN for the past two years, once in the capacity of delegate in the Security Council, and last year as a Chairperson of the JCC Chinese Cabinet. Apart from being an avid MUN’er, my interests range from football and music to wildlife conservation and writing.</p>
                                <p>I’m incredibly eager to see how you delegates use your knowledge of the current geopolitical scenario to resolve conflicts that may have a long-lasting effect. I can assure you that this year’s Security Council at DSMUN 2016 is going to be an experience that all you delegates will remember for a very long time. This year’s volatile and controversy prone agendas stand as:</p>
                                <p><ul><li><b>Conflict in the South China Sea Area</b></li>
                                <li><b>South Korea-North Korea Dispute</b></li></ul></p>
                                <p>I look forward to seeing you all at The Doon School in August.</p>

                          <h3>Agenda 1: The Korean Dispute</h3>
                          <p>The hostility and numerous clashes came into rise post World War Two, out of which the diaspora regarding Korea has escalated to an extent that it proves to be a threat to modern society even today., and the  near future. The picture we have today is of a Cold War between the land of communism and anti-communism where neither of the countries is willing to lead a step of concession.  We soon observe major political figures in these countries to be Korean nationals such as Syngam Rhee as President of South Korea and Kim Two Sung as Leader of North Korea.  Over the years, this conflict between these two nations has proven to be one of the biggest threats to international security and peace, both in Asia and the world as a whole. It is of the utmost importance that the Security Council rise and solve this pressing issue.</p>
                          <h3>Agenda 2: The South China Sea Dispute</h3>
                          <p>A conflict which arose as early as 1945 when the Second World War had just concluded is still a matter of concern today. Certainly, the everlasting conflict over the South China Sea has proven to be one of the most long-lasting skirmishes in World History. Ever since the various territorial claims which began with China reclaiming the whole zone from Japan posts the Second World War. Over the years many causes have been described as to what is keeping these countries delved in this conflict ; one being that the 2 archipelagoes have proven to be an important site for the fishing industry and titles 8% of the total world fish catch, second having rich oil and natural gas deposits and third being one of the busiest shipping routes in the world .Having signed various treaties and agreements, none of the countries seem to show any form of compromise .The United Nations Convention on the Law of The Sea (UNCLOS) which was brought into force in 1994 was a major attempt to solve the arising struggle in the South China Sea has by far worsened the situation as different countries have derived various interpretations of the Law. The situation in the South China Sea is indeed deteriorating daily and as members of the Security Council it is the council’s responsibility to curb any further escalation of the crisis, but most importantly reach a peaceful situation that’ll ensure further peace and stable diplomatic relations between the nations engaged in the conflict.</p>
