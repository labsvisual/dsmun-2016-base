                                    Dear delegates,
                                </p>
                                <p>Welcome to the first African Union Committee at DSMUN. I am Vansh Aggarwal and I am thrilled to be your director at DSMUN ’16. Before I go on to the specifics about the committee, I’ll start by introducing myself. I am a student at The Doon School pursuing the IB Diploma Programme. I have been an avid MUNer and have attended conferences both nationally and internationally. Besides MUN, I am the Editor-in-Chief of the school Yearbook and an enthusiastic sportsman. As such, my interests lie mainly in the field of Economics and Politics.</p>
                                <p>As far as the committee goes, this is the first time the African Union is being done at this conference. Last year, I was the Assistant Director of the Joint Crisis Committee: Hindustan Cabinet. Therefore, I’m looking forward to the change in the committee dynamic and conducting this committee at DSMUN.  The African Union is a body with very specific goals and a vision to make “An integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa, driven by its own citizens and representing a dynamic force in the global arena.”</p>
                                <p>This year we plan to debate on two very significant and diverse topics in this committee. The first is “Neo-colonialism in Africa” which focuses on the economics of foreign investment in Africa by nations such as China. The second, “Blood Diamond Supply Chain”, focuses on the social implications of a legalized diamond trade in Africa. Both the topics are on matters of international concern and need to be addressed by all member nations.</p>
                                <p>I hope this realistic yet challenging simulation will test the intellectual and diplomatic capability of every delegate. I expect all delegates to be ‘aware’ of the developments in current affairs and be familiar with their foreign policy. Further, I expect everyone to maintain a high level of debate and the committee to adopt a holistic approach towards the agendas. Also, ones ability to lobby and lead blocs will be highly judged upon, as diplomacy forms the core of any Model United Nations Conference. So be prepared for three days of intense debate, heated arguments, lobbying and above all, meeting new people and making friends.</p>
                                <p>I look forward to seeing all of you here at Chandbagh this fall.</p>

                          <h3>Agenda 1: Neocolonialism in Africa</h3>
                          <p>In the recent years, Chinese investment in Africa has increased significantly. The total trade surpassed USD 200 billion in 2013 and the Sino-African cooperation has contributed to over 20% of Africa’s economic development. As China continues to strengthen its economic influence in Africa and gain control over African resources, many nations are concerned regarding external Chinese aid and economic overdependence of African nations on China. The African Union is directly concerned with Chinese activities in the continent and must decide on its boundaries and to what extent can China intervene in Africa’s internal affairs. Delegates must consider the possibility that if the African Union does not take adequate action immediately, Africa’s domestic and foreign policy could be determined by China in the future and the continent could face the risk of Chinese exploitation.
                            </p>
                          <h3>Agenda 2: Blood Diamond Supply Chain</h3>
                          <p>African Union’s vision of the continent for the continent is hampered by high revenue sale of conflict diamonds. Diamonds in Africa are mined under rebel groups in Africa and help to fund antigovernment military action. These rebel groups are responsible for multiple human rights violations including deaths, murders and unlawful activities. Illicit diamond trade impacts all African nations and their impact is much more than just economic. African nations must find a solution to diamond trade in order progress economically, socially and politically.</p>
